--------------
Find out all possble 3-digit Triode Numbers.
Let x be a Triode Number, then x, 2*x and 3*x will have all distinct digits.

As example:
	if x = 219, then 2*x = 438 and 3*x = 657, all these three numbers having all distinct digits
	So x = 219 is a Triode Number.
	
	if x = 192, then 2*x = 384 and 3*x = 576, all these three numbers having all distinct digits
	So x = 192 is a Triode Number.
