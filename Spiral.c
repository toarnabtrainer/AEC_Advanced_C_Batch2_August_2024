
SPIRAL FILL UP OF A MATRIX (CLOCK-WISE)
--------------------------------------
Fill up a matrix with dimension (nxn), where n has been taken from user input,
with numbers ranging from 1 to n^2, using them once in clock wise spiral manner
starting from top left corner of the matrix.

As example -
if n = 5
      0   1   2   3   4
--------------------------
 0 |  1   2   3   4   5
 1 | 16  17  18  19   6
 2 | 15  24  25  20   7
 3 | 14  23  22  21   8
 4 | 13  12  11  10   9
